\section{Timing is young}
% Timing is a young field - compared to learning.
%  we should engage with both

\section{Our vantage point}
% Now we can assess learning of timing in rats in the brain activity. 
    \subsection{An unique task}
    % It was not possible. Problems. DRRD task
    \subsection{Contemporary analysis techniques}
    % Machine learning. Population coding

\section{Potential contributions}
% This enables us to contribute to
