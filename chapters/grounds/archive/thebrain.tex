    The representations we discuss here are taken in the weak sense: any internal pattern that reliably covaries with an external one may be said to represent, or \textit{encode} it \cite{rosch1991embodied}, and in this sense there is no shortage of time representations in the brain. On the other hand, the representations that interest us are those actually causing impact in subsequent behavior, and for this end they must also be accessible to processes needing them.
