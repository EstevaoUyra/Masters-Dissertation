\chapter{Open  Code}
All authored code is available at https://github.com/EstevaoUyra/spikelearn, under the permissive MIT Licence. Every procedure has been written in Python, while some wrappers have been written in bash.

% \subsection{Functions and Documentation}
To enable other researchers to apply the analysis as easier as possible, most of the code was transformed into \textit{functions}. They have been documented using the Numpy style\footnote{Available in https://www.numpy.org/devdocs/docs/howto\_document.html}, which enables automatic generation of documentation web pages via the sphinx package\footnote{http://www.sphinx-doc.org/}. 

% \subsection{Packaging}
To manage the dependencies, and enable installation of the code, we used the \textit{pip} package manager\footnote{https://pypi.org/project/pip/}. This is done through the creation of a single file called \textit{setup.py}, which contains information about requirements and about the package itself.
