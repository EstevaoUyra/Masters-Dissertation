To measure consistency in the neural activity in the simplest way, we applied Mahalanobis Distance to trials in a rolling manner. That is, we measured the distance between each time point at a given correct trial and the mean of the 30 previous ones. If activity gains consistency as training progresses, then the mean distance should decrease with the trial number. In order to be
