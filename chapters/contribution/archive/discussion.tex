Complementarily, optogenetic stimulation of the mPFC suffices to learn associations such as Eye Blink Conditioning \cite{wu2015optogenetic}, and its ensemble activity encodes relevant cues after rewards \cite{maggi2018ensemble}. 
    
even though learning induces lasting changes in the mPFC's responses to related stimuli \cite{takehara2008spontaneous}.
    
The opposite has been shown in other tasks \cite{pasupathy2005different}, where activity in the Striatum predicts response faster than the PFC, motivating a model where the basal ganglia is the one who provides the reinforcement signals to the cortex \cite{helie2015learning}.
