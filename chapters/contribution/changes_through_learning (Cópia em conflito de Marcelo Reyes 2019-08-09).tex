\chapter{Representation changes with learning}

To measure how the time representation changes with learning, we will compare the neural activity extracted from distinct learning stages. Specifically, we divide into the first and second half of the session for the group with long sessions, and into the first and second sessions for the group with short sessions. This is because for the first group we had long sessions of more than 1000 trials $(1149 \pm 384)$ with sufficient correct trials $(660 \pm 260)$. For the second group of animals, in which sessions were half as long with $570 \pm 181$ trials, there were only and $284\pm 100$ correct trials, less than half compared to the first group.

We will measure the quality of time representation using the same machine learning regression technique from the previous chapter. The number of neurons used in each group and each area was the same, and was kept constant in the multiple learning stages.

When we compare the performance of classifiers as measured by Pearson correlation (figure \ref{fig:evolution_representation_pearson}), we see opposite trends for the two recorded areas. Performance in the mPFC decreases in both groups, while in the second group performance in the Striatum increases. The same pattern can be found in \ref{fig:evolution_representation_variance}, when measuring the same results with the explained variance metric. The main distinction between the results from each metric resides in the second session of the striatum, that is closer in value to the second session for the mPFC. All the distinctions between learning stages are statistically significant, shown in table \ref{tab:statistics_learning_stage}. 

In terms of Pearson's r, the only data in which the regression had null performance was the first session of the Striatum, in \ref{fig:evolution_representation_pearson}. If we look at the prediction distribution in \ref{fig:evolution_representation_density}, it is possible to see that the predictions are very close to a horizontal line, similar to the shuffled data. Differently, in the second session the distribution shows positive inclination, consistent with the increase in Pearson's r score.

The explained variance was null or negative in both sessions for the striatum

Medial Pre Frontal Cortex decreased its inclination

We applied paired-sample T tests to compare each pair of training stages for each area recorded. Tests are shown for both Explained variance and Pearson's r metrics. In each cell, we have the t-value at left and the p-value at right. Values below .05 are considered statistically significant. Positive t-values indicate increase in the second stage with comparison to the first, and negative t-values indicate decrease.}
