We used henceforth classification performance as a proxy to neural representation. Since we want to understand how information about time develops in the brain during learning of the task, we compared this classification performance in the beginning of the session and near the end of the session. Before making this comparison, we tested multiple classifiers to be sure that any kind of information captured by then is not specific to the classifier.
